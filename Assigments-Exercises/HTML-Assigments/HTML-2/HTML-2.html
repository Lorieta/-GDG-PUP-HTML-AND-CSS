    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        I am John Carlo Lorieta, an aspiring AI researcher, passionate software developer, and a deep thinker.  
        When I'm not coding or researching, I love pondering life's big questions, often diving into philosophy to understand  
        the world from a different perspective. I'm also committed to pushing my limits in the gym, constantly working to improve  
        my physical strength as much as my mental abilities.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        Whether it's analyzing the meaning of life or breaking personal records in the gym, I’m always engaged in activities that  
        help me grow. I’m a gym bro at heart, lifting heavy, and staying active. Outside of fitness and philosophy, I enjoy exploring  
        new technologies and staying up to date with the latest trends in AI.
    </p>

        "If you're jacked, read a book. If you're smart, go to the gym. A jacked nerd is unstoppable."

    <h2>Other</h2>
    <p>
        I’m always open to meaningful conversations, whether they’re about AI, philosophy, or how to push past mental and physical  
        barriers. Let's work together to build something amazing and dive deep into the fascinating aspects of both technology and life!
